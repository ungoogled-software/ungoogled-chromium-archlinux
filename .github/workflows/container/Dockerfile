# This container will be used to build ungoogled-chromium-archlinux within.
# It contains all build dependencies, as such providing full control over them regardless of
# host environment.

# There are 3 directories that can be mounted in the container to influence its behavior:

# - /mnt/input: If containing a "progress.tar.zst" archive, with the corresponding sha256 checksum in "progress.tar.zst.sum",
#               that contains a src directory with build process, said src directory will be used to continue the build.
# - /mnt/output: Contains the built package file after a successfull full build
# - /mnt/progress: Contains the current build progress in form of a "progress.tar.zst" archive with a corresponding sha256
#                  checksum, "progress.tar.zst.sum", after a successfull partial or full build

# Partial builds are limited by a timeout which can be set by passing the TIMEOUT enironment variable to the container.
